# Pneumonia Classifier

This project aims to classify chest x-ray images into penumonia-positive, or pneumonia-negative labels.

The dataset came from a Kaggle Competition and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## Project Flow

1. Load images
2. Reshape image arrays
3. Design Convolutional Neural Network
4. Fit Neural Net to training data
5. Assess test data on neural network and compute error
